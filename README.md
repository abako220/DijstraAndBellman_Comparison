# DijstraAndBellman_Comparison
The aim of this work is to do a comparative analysis of shortest path algorithms, to enable us know which is best for finding the shortest path from the source node to the destination node. And the objective are as follows: 

a. To implement Dijkstra and Bellman-ford shortest path algorithms. 

b. To determine the shortest path from the source node to the destination node. 

c. To evaluate the performance of the algorithms in terms of memory utilization and time complexity of the algorithms.
